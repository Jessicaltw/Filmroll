        Every time I pick up a roll of Kodak Gold 200, I get nostalgic for days long past. Gold 200 was a staple in my household. It was cheap, 
        and you could find it practically anywhere. I put countless rolls of the stuff through my dadâ€™s Pentax ME Super and my thrift store Bell and Howell point and shoot.
